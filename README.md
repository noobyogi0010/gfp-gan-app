# GFP-GAN App

This is a simple react web app that demonstrates the amazing power of GFP-GAN. This repository is inspired by the continuous tweets regarding how great GFP-GAN is at converting low resolution face images to really crisp and high quality face images.

## Demo

## Local Setup

You can run the project in your local system using the following commands:

- Install all the project dependencies using the following command:

    `npm install`

- Run the following command to start the system:

    `npm run start`

## Just FYI...

If you are looking for the api server implementation, then you can find it here: [**GFP-GAN-Server**](https://github.com/noobyogi0010/gfp-gan-server).

## Future Scope

This can be considered as the base version of this application, as I am planning to develop it further with much more enhancements. As of now following are the things that I have forethought to work upon in the upcoming months:

- Allowing more than 3 images to be enhanced at a time.

- Make the code more modular by breaking obvious implementations into independent components.

- Improve the code quality by learning more best practices for React and Typescript.

- Improve the UI to give more simple and intutive way for users to enhance their image quality.

- Add a feature to download enhanced image in multiple formats.
